# Mesh Network Layer for nRF24L01(+) radios
It is only for uni-directional sensor networks.
There is one sink node, all the other nodes have sensors or forwarding only nodes.
If there is at least one network between sensor and the  sink it reaches to the sink.
Since the memory of arduino uno is very limited, buffer overflow of the nodes must be considered during operation.
